# This tool checks all applications bundles on the typical OS X installation
# paths whether they contain an outdated [MITM-vulnerable][1] version of
# Sparkle.
# If that's the case, it does some further heuristics checks to try to
# determine whether the application's updater is actually vulnerable.
# In the end, it uses this information to classify the risk, where the
# classifications may take the following values:
#
# *IMMINENT DANGER*: the heuristics indicate that it can't be assured, that
# using the updater won't compromise the system.
# In the best case, the app publisher provides updated binaries with a patched
# version of Sparkle, which isn't vulnerable or avoids using unencrypted
# HTTP connections for retrieving the AppCast, as strongly encouraged by
# Sparkle's documentation.
# Alternative countermeasures may range from restricting the apps network
# functionalities to putting the app under quarantine.
#
# *UNKNOWN*: the app was compiled against an older SDK, so that [ATS][2] is not
# active or there are exclusions from ATS, while the feed URL for the AppCast
# is not declared in the Info.plist, so it has to be programmatically provided,
# which can't be determined by statical analysis. Nevertheless the tool
# inspects all string literals in the executable to find all HTTP URLs, which
# might include the feed URL. This strategy has limits and can't catch URLs,
# which weren't fully hardcoded as strings or obfuscated in another way. The
# found URLs are printed for further investigation through the user to allow a
# better risk estimation. If an insecure URL serving an AppCast can be found,
# it is likely that the app is vulnerable, otherwise it can't be excluded.
#
# *BROKEN UPDATER*: the app doesn't have exclusions from ATS while the feed
# URL is insecure and it was compiled against OS X 10.11 SDK, which causes that
# ATS is enabled and insecure HTTP requests are blocked by default. That means
# the updater won't be able to download any updates.
